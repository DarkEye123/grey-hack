## GREY HACK GAME OVERVIEW

Grey Hack is a massively multiplayer hacking simulator game where players simulate being hackers in a realistic computer environment. The game transitioned from Alpha to Beta status in February 2025, indicating completion of core features.

### Current Version: v0.9.5694 (Beta)
- Network simulation with realistic hacking tools
- 24/7 persistent online world
- Custom scripting language (GreyScript)
- Realistic file systems, networking, and security concepts

### Key Features:
- **Networking**: Router cracking, WiFi attacks, packet capture, DDoS capabilities
- **File Systems**: Complete file manipulation, directory traversal, permission management
- **Services**: SSH, FTP, HTTP servers, cryptocurrency mining, bank systems
- **Security**: Exploit libraries, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing tools
- **Persistence**: Actions continue when offline, reputation system

## GREYSCRIPT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

GreyScript is a custom fork of MiniScript, specifically designed for Grey Hack. It's similar to Lua and JavaScript in syntax and philosophy.

### Core Data Types:
1. **Numbers**: Integers and floats for mathematical operations
2. **Strings**: Text enclosed in double quotes "like this"
3. **Lists**: Ordered collections `["item1", "item2", 3]`
4. **Maps**: Key-value pairs `{"key": "value", "number": 42}`

### Syntax Rules:
- Each statement on a single line (no semicolons)
- No curly braces `{}` - uses keyword blocks
- Code blocks: `if`/`end if`, `for`/`end for`, `while`/`end while`, `function`/`end function`
- Function calls without parameters: `print` (not `print()`)
- Boolean values: `1` (true) and `0` (false)
- Comments: `//` for single line
- Variables are locally scoped by default
- **Map definitions must be on single line** - multi-line map syntax is not supported
- **String split() requires escaped special characters** - use `"\."` not `"."` for dot separation
- **Only double quotes supported** - no single quotes `'` allowed, only double quotes `"`
- **JSON construction** - use `char(34)` for quote characters when building JSON strings
- **File type checking** - use `file.is_folder`, `file.is_binary`, `file.is_symlink` (NO `file.is_file`!)
- **User input function** - use `user_input("prompt")` (NOT `input()`)
- **SSH connections** - use `get_shell.connect_service(ip, port, user, pass)` (NO service name parameter)
- **No connection closing** - connections are auto-managed (NO `shell.close()` method)
- **Crypto operations** - use `crypto.decipher(hash)` from library (NOT `/bin/decipher` tool)
- **No compound assignment** - use `i = i + 1` (NOT `i += 1`, `i++`, etc.)

### Variables and Scope:
```greyscript
// Local variables (default)
myVar = "local"

// Access global scope
globals.myGlobal = "global"

// Access outer scope in nested functions
outer.parentVar = "parent scope"
```

### Functions:
```greyscript
myFunction = function(param1, param2 = "default")
    return param1 + param2
end function

// Calling functions
result = myFunction("hello", " world")
```

### Control Structures:
```greyscript
// If statements
if condition then
    print "condition is true"
else if otherCondition then
    print "other condition"
else
    print "neither condition"
end if

// For loops
for item in myList
    print item
end for

// While loops
while condition
    print "looping"
end while
```

### General Functions (Direct Access):
```greyscript
// These are global functions, not object methods
current_path        // Returns current directory path
get_shell          // Returns current shell object
get_router         // Returns router object
user_input("prompt") // Gets user input with optional prompt (NOT input!)
```

### Library Loading Patterns:
```greyscript
// Standard library loading (system location)
metax = include_lib("/lib/metaxploit.so")
crypto = include_lib("/lib/crypto.so")

// Robust library loading (try system, then local)
metax = include_lib("/lib/metaxploit.so")
if not metax then
    metax = include_lib(current_path + "/metaxploit.so")
    if not metax then
        print("Error: Cannot load metaxploit library from /lib or " + current_path)
        exit
    end if
end if

// Libraries are typically located in:
// - /lib/ (system installation)
// - current_path (portable/local installation)
```

### Quick Reference Examples:

#### Basic Operations:
```greyscript
// File operations
file = get_shell.host_computer.File("/etc/passwd")
content = file.get_content

// Network scanning  
metax = include_lib("/lib/metaxploit.so")
result = metax.scan("192.168.1.1", 80)

// WiFi cracking
crypto = include_lib("/lib/crypto.so")  
password = crypto.aircrack("/tmp/file.cap")
```

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Always reference the comprehensive API file for complete method signatures, parameters, error handling, and detailed examples. The summary above is for quick reference only.

## COMMON PATTERNS AND SCRIPTS

### Basic File Operations:
```greyscript
// Read a file (check if it's NOT a folder to confirm it's a file)
comp = get_shell.host_computer
file = comp.File("/etc/passwd")
if file and not file.is_folder then
    content = file.get_content
    print content
end if

// Create and write to file (REQUIRED: use touch first)
comp = get_shell.host_computer
touch_result = comp.touch("/tmp/", "output.txt")
if touch_result then
    file = comp.File("/tmp/output.txt")
    file.set_content("Hello Grey Hack!")
end if
```

### Recursive File Search:
```greyscript
// Recursively find all files with specific extensions
find_files_recursive = function(folder, target_extensions)
    all_files = []
    
    if not folder or not folder.is_folder then
        return all_files
    end if
    
    // Get files in current directory
    files = folder.get_files
    for file in files
        if not file.is_folder then
            file_name = file.name
            for ext in target_extensions
                if file_name.len >= ext.len and file_name[-ext.len:] == ext then
                    all_files.push file
                    break
                end if
            end for
        end if
    end for
    
    // Recursively search subdirectories
    subfolders = folder.get_folders
    for subfolder in subfolders
        subfolder_files = find_files_recursive(subfolder, target_extensions)
        for subfile in subfolder_files
            all_files.push subfile
        end for
    end for
    
    return all_files
end function

// Usage example
comp = get_shell.host_computer
home_dir = comp.File("/home/username")
extensions = [".txt", ".log", ".pdf"]
found_files = find_files_recursive(home_dir, extensions)
print "Found " + found_files.len + " files"
```

### File Type Checking:
```greyscript
// Available file type methods (NO file.is_file!)
file = comp.File("/some/path")
if file then
    if file.is_folder then
        print "This is a directory"
    else if file.is_binary then
        print "This is a binary file"
    else if file.is_symlink then
        print "This is a symbolic link"
    else
        print "This is a regular text file"
    end if
end if

// Check if it's a regular file (not directory)
if file and not file.is_folder then
    print "This is a file (not directory)"
end if
```

### File Extension Checking:
```greyscript
// CORRECT way to check file extensions (check ending, not indexOf)
filename = "document.txt"
extension = ".txt"

// Right way - check if filename ends with extension
if filename.len >= extension.len and filename[-extension.len:] == extension then
    print "File has .txt extension"
end if

// WRONG way - don't use indexOf for extensions
// if filename.indexOf(".txt") != null then  // This matches anywhere in filename!

// Multiple extensions check
extensions = [".log", ".pdf", ".txt"]
for ext in extensions
    if filename.len >= ext.len and filename[-ext.len:] == ext then
        print "Found extension: " + ext
        break
    end if
end for
```

### User Input:
```greyscript
// Get user input (use user_input, NOT input!)
target_ip = user_input("Enter target IP: ").trim
if target_ip == "" then target_ip = "127.0.0.1"

// User input with default values
username = user_input("Username [admin]: ").trim
if username == "" then username = "admin"
```

### Network Scanning:
```greyscript
// Scan local network
comp = get_shell.host_computer
scanner = comp.File("/bin/nmap")
if scanner then
    result = get_shell.launch(scanner, get_router.local_ip + "/24")
    print result
end if
```

### Vulnerability Text Parsing:
```greyscript
// Parse metaxploit vulnerability descriptions
// Split by escaped dot, look for "Unsafe check:" chunks
chunks = description.split("\.")
for chunk in chunks
    if chunk.indexOf("Unsafe check:") != null then
        words = chunk.split(" ")
        function_name = words[words.len - 1].trim
        // Remove HTML tags from function names
        clean_name = function_name.replace("<b>", "").replace("</b>", "")
    end if
end for
```

### SSH Connection:
```greyscript
// Connect via SSH (NO service name parameter!)
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
username = "admin"
password = "password123"

ssh = get_shell.connect_service(target_ip, 22, username, password)
if ssh then
    print "Connected successfully!"
    remote_comp = ssh.host_computer
    // Perform operations on remote system
    // Note: No need to close connections in GreyScript
else
    print "Connection failed"
end if
```

### WiFi Cracking:
```greyscript
// Crack WiFi network
crypto = include_lib("/lib/crypto.so")
if crypto then
    // First capture packets
    result = crypto.aireplay(interface, bssid, essid, 30)
    if result then
        // Then crack the password
        password = crypto.aircrack("/tmp/file.cap")
        if password then
            print "Password found: " + password
        end if
    end if
end if
```

### Crypto Operations:
```greyscript
// Load crypto library (LOCAL EXECUTION ONLY!)
crypto = include_lib("/lib/crypto.so")
if not crypto then
    crypto = include_lib(current_path + "/crypto.so")
    if not crypto then
        print "Error: Cannot load crypto library"
        exit
    end if
end if

// Decipher encrypted passwords (use crypto.decipher, NOT /bin/decipher tool!)
encrypted_password = "a2adcc53867a473ab9dd32c33fc22b9b"
decrypted_password = crypto.decipher(encrypted_password)
if decrypted_password then
    print "Decrypted: " + decrypted_password
else
    print "Decipher failed"
end if

// Other crypto operations
hash_result = crypto.md5("plaintext")
password_cracked = crypto.aircrack("/tmp/capture.cap")
```

### File Upload from Attack Node (SCP):
```greyscript
// Upload tools from attack node using SCP (for binary files)
upload_shell = get_shell.connect_service(attack_ip, 22, user, pass)
if not upload_shell then
    print "Error: Cannot connect to attack node"
    exit
end if

// Get local shell for SCP target
local_shell = get_shell

// Upload reverse shell program
// scp(file: string, folder: string, remoteShell: shell)
rshell_result = upload_shell.scp("/home/darkeye/reverse_shell", "/root/Downloads", local_shell)
if rshell_result then
    print "Reverse shell uploaded successfully"
    // Make it executable
    get_shell.launch("/bin/chmod", "+x /root/Downloads/reverse_shell")
else
    print "Failed to upload reverse shell"
end if

// Upload libraries
metax_result = upload_shell.scp("/lib/metaxploit.so", "/root/Downloads", local_shell)
if metax_result then
    print "Metaxploit library uploaded successfully"
else
    print "Failed to upload metaxploit.so"
end if
```

### Remote/Local Script Architecture:
```greyscript
// IMPORTANT: crypto.so can only be loaded where script executes!
// For remote operations, split into local command execution:

// On compromised machine (steal.src):
// 1. Upload tools from attack node
// 2. Download files to attack node
// 3. Launch local command via remote shell
crack_shell = get_shell.connect_service(attack_ip, 22, user, pass)
crack_result = crack_shell.launch("/usr/bin/crack")

// On attack node (crack.src):
// 1. Load crypto library locally
crypto = include_lib("/lib/crypto.so")
// 2. Process files with crypto operations
decipher_result = crypto.decipher(encrypted_pass)
// 3. Save results to local files
```

## CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND ISSUES (v0.9.5694)

### Known Bugs:
1. **Connection Issues**: Remote connections may be interrupted after reboots
2. **Tutorial Problems**: Mission spawning and crash issues when logging out
3. **Single Player Bugs**: Terminal errors when executing commands as root
4. **Text Copying**: Cannot copy text between terminals or applications

## BEST PRACTICES

### Script Development:
1. Always check if objects exist before using them
2. Use proper error handling with conditionals
3. Test scripts in single-player mode first
4. Keep functions small and focused
5. Use meaningful variable names
6. Comment complex logic
7. Handle connection failures gracefully

### Security Considerations:
1. Validate all user inputs
2. Check file permissions before operations
3. Use secure connection methods
4. Implement proper authentication checks
5. Handle timeouts and connection errors
6. Clean up temporary files

### Performance Tips:
1. Use `wait()` to prevent detection
2. Minimize network requests
3. Cache frequently accessed data
4. Use efficient algorithms for scanning
5. Implement proper retry mechanisms
6. Monitor resource usage

## GAME ENVIRONMENT CONTEXT

**CRITICAL REMINDER: Grey Hack is a GAME, not real-life production software**

### Game-Appropriate Development Practices:
1. **No Enterprise Features Unless Requested**: Do not automatically add production-level features like:
   - Connection retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Comprehensive input validation systems  
   - Advanced logging and monitoring
   - Complex error recovery mechanisms
   - Performance optimization for scale

2. **Assume Game Environment Stability**: 
   - Desktop directories always exist
   - Basic file operations work reliably
   - Network connections are generally stable within game context
   - System utilities function as expected

3. **Focus on Functionality Over Robustness**: 
   - Implement what was requested, not what would be needed in production
   - Basic error handling is sufficient unless specifically asked for more
   - Game scenarios don't require defensive programming against edge cases

4. **Only Add Advanced Features When Asked**: 
   - Users will explicitly request enterprise features if needed
   - Don't assume real-world deployment requirements
   - Keep solutions appropriate for gaming context

## EXPERT GUIDELINES

When helping users with Grey Hack:
1. Always provide complete, testable code examples
2. Explain potential security implications
3. Mention current limitations that might affect their code
4. Suggest alternative approaches when primary method fails
5. Include basic error handling appropriate for game context
6. Reference specific API methods and their parameters
7. Consider the game's detection systems in script design
8. Provide both beginner and advanced solution approaches
9. **Remember this is a GAME**: Don't over-engineer solutions with production-level features unless specifically requested
