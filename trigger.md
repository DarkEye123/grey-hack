### Key Features:
- **Networking**: Router cracking, WiFi attacks, packet capture, DDoS capabilities
- **File Systems**: Complete file manipulation, directory traversal, permission management
- **Services**: SSH, FTP, HTTP servers, cryptocurrency mining, bank systems
- **Security**: Exploit libraries, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing tools
- **Persistence**: Actions continue when offline, reputation system

## GREYSCRIPT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE

GreyScript is a custom fork of MiniScript, specifically designed for Grey Hack. It's similar to Lua and JavaScript in syntax and philosophy.

### Core Data Types:
1. **Numbers**: Integers and floats for mathematical operations
2. **Strings**: Text enclosed in double quotes "like this"
3. **Lists**: Ordered collections `["item1", "item2", 3]`
4. **Maps**: Key-value pairs `{"key": "value", "number": 42}`

### Syntax Rules:
- Each statement on a single line (no semicolons)
- No curly braces `{}` - uses keyword blocks
- Code blocks: `if`/`end if`, `for`/`end for`, `while`/`end while`, `function`/`end function`
- Function calls without parameters: `print` (not `print()`)
- Boolean values: `1` (true) and `0` (false)
- Comments: `//` for single line
- Variables are locally scoped by default
- **Map definitions must be on single line** - multi-line map syntax is not supported
- **String split() requires escaped special characters** - use `"\."` not `"."` for dot separation
- **Only double quotes supported** - no single quotes `'` allowed, only double quotes `"`
- **JSON construction** - use `char(34)` for quote characters when building JSON strings

### Variables and Scope:
```greyscript
// Local variables (default)
myVar = "local"

// Access global scope
globals.myGlobal = "global"

// Access outer scope in nested functions
outer.parentVar = "parent scope"
```

### Functions:
```greyscript
myFunction = function(param1, param2 = "default")
    return param1 + param2
end function

// Calling functions
result = myFunction("hello", " world")
```

### Control Structures:
```greyscript
// If statements
if condition then
    print "condition is true"
else if otherCondition then
    print "other condition"
else
    print "neither condition"
end if

// For loops
for item in myList
    print item
end for

// While loops
while condition
    print "looping"
end while
```

### General Functions (Direct Access):
```greyscript
// These are global functions, not object methods
current_path        // Returns current directory path
get_shell          // Returns current shell object
get_router         // Returns router object
```

### Library Loading Patterns:
```greyscript
// Standard library loading (system location)
metax = include_lib("/lib/metaxploit.so")
crypto = include_lib("/lib/crypto.so")

// Robust library loading (try system, then local)
metax = include_lib("/lib/metaxploit.so")
if not metax then
    metax = include_lib(current_path + "/metaxploit.so")
    if not metax then
        print("Error: Cannot load metaxploit library from /lib or " + current_path)
        exit
    end if
end if

// Libraries are typically located in:
// - /lib/ (system installation)
// - current_path (portable/local installation)
```

### Quick Reference Examples:

#### Basic Operations:
```greyscript
// File operations
file = get_shell.host_computer.File("/etc/passwd")
content = file.get_content

// Network scanning  
metax = include_lib("/lib/metaxploit.so")
result = metax.scan("192.168.1.1", 80)

// WiFi cracking
crypto = include_lib("/lib/crypto.so")  
password = crypto.aircrack("/tmp/file.cap")
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Always reference the comprehensive API file for complete method signatures, parameters, error handling, and detailed examples. The summary above is for quick reference only.

## COMMON PATTERNS AND SCRIPTS

### Basic File Operations:
```greyscript
// Read a file
comp = get_shell.host_computer
file = comp.File("/etc/passwd")
if file and file.is_file then
    content = file.get_content
    print content
end if

// Create and write to file (REQUIRED: use touch first)
comp = get_shell.host_computer
touch_result = comp.touch("/tmp/", "output.txt")
if touch_result then
    file = comp.File("/tmp/output.txt")
    file.set_content("Hello Grey Hack!")
end if
```

### Network Scanning:
```greyscript
// Scan local network
comp = get_shell.host_computer
scanner = comp.File("/bin/nmap")
if scanner then
    result = get_shell.launch(scanner, get_router.local_ip + "/24")
    print result
end if
```

### Vulnerability Text Parsing:
```greyscript
// Parse metaxploit vulnerability descriptions
// Split by escaped dot, look for "Unsafe check:" chunks
chunks = description.split("\.")
for chunk in chunks
    if chunk.indexOf("Unsafe check:") != null then
        words = chunk.split(" ")
        function_name = words[words.len - 1].trim
        // Remove HTML tags from function names
        clean_name = function_name.replace("<b>", "").replace("</b>", "")
    end if
end for
```

### SSH Connection:
```greyscript
// Connect via SSH
target_ip = "192.168.1.100"
username = "admin"
password = "password123"

ssh = get_shell.connect_service(target_ip, 22, "ssh", username, password)
if ssh then
    print "Connected successfully!"
    remote_comp = ssh.host_computer
    // Perform operations on remote system
else
    print "Connection failed"
end if
```

### WiFi Cracking:
```greyscript
// Crack WiFi network
crypto = include_lib("/lib/crypto.so")
if crypto then
    // First capture packets
    result = crypto.aireplay(interface, bssid, essid, 30)
    if result then
        // Then crack the password
        password = crypto.aircrack("/tmp/file.cap")
        if password then
            print "Password found: " + password
        end if
    end if
end if
```

## CURRENT LIMITATIONS AND ISSUES (v0.9.5694)

### Known Bugs:
1. **Connection Issues**: Remote connections may be interrupted after reboots
2. **Tutorial Problems**: Mission spawning and crash issues when logging out
3. **Single Player Bugs**: Terminal errors when executing commands as root
4. **Text Copying**: Cannot copy text between terminals or applications
5. **Permission System**: Sudo command and permissions are incomplete and buggy

### Game Balance Issues:
1. **Detection Problems**: Players getting caught too quickly regardless of actions
2. **Mission Difficulty**: Some missions require exploits that don't exist
3. **Passive Trace**: Currently disabled in experimental builds
4. **System Logs**: May not generate correctly for connections/deletions

### Technical Limitations:
1. **File Creation**: Files must be created with `computer.touch(directory, filename)` before writing content
2. **Rental Connections**: Automatic connection from Map doesn't work
3. **Service Crashes**: HTTP service configuration and stock purchasing issues
4. **Desktop Icons**: UI problems with desktop icon management
5. **Character Limits**: Some bypasses in text input fields

### Development Status:
- Beta phase with main mechanics complete but ongoing bugs
